Use shortcodes to display Zettle stock on your Wordpress website.


== Description ==
This plugin does the following:

- Allow you to easily connect it to your Zettle with a Zettle Integration.
- Fetch the products and stock/balance from your Zettle.
- Cache that information for at least one minute to avoid making too many API calls.
- Use shortcodes to display the name, price, and stock information of your WordPress website.

These shortcodes are available:

- `zettle_name` to show the name of a product.
- `zettle_price` to show the price of a product.
- `zettle_stock` to show the stock/balance of a product.

Every time you use the shortcode, you must include a `uuid` attribute.

Example:

- `[zettle_name uuid=\"gy5d6ey2-1584-58es-2642-56dls72fpr3c\"]` -> `Socks`
- `[zettle_price uuid=\"gy5d6ey2-1584-58es-2642-56dls72fpr3c\"]` -> `â‚¬8,00`
- `[zettle_stock uuid=\"gy5d6ey2-1584-58es-2642-56dls72fpr3c\"]` -> `67`
